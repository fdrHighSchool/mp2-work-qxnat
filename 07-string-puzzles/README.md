# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * Using the index of the String (0 to end of string), depending on variable a, itll start at that point to the end of string.

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * Instead of all the way to the end of string, it stops at whatever number is inserted for variable b, and start at variable a

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * Checks to see if a certain letter is in a string

  * `.equals(str)`
    * Check to see if string is equal to another string


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * the for loop repeats itself until i = length of variable s.
